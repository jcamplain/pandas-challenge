By splitting the data into just genders and age groups listed for the current players in Heroes of Pymoli, we can see that the majority of people that play this particular game are male players. We found that males make up 84.03%, females 14.06%, and other/non-disclosed a total of 1.91%. When looking at the range of ages in the data set, we can see that 44.79% of all players that play this particular game are between the ages of 20-24 and 18.58% of players are ages 15-19. 

Now we could use this data to find our target market for advertising this game. We would want our target market to be males aged between 20-24 which could also include ages 15-19 as well, because according to our data set this is what makes up the majority of our current players. 

One more aspect we could look at is how we could possibly increase our revenue stream per player. In our data set by age groups we calculated the average total purchase per person. We can see that out of our eight age ranges we are looking at, four age ranges spent at least $4 on average and the other four ranges at least $3 per purchase. With this data we can create a secondary target market that only markets these age ranges to try to increase our revenue within the game. The four ranges being 35-39 spent $4.76, ages 10 or less spent $4.54, 20-24 spent $4.32, and 30-34 spent $4.12 on average. Now this can make up our secondary target market. I would consider taking out 20-24 age range in our secondary target market due this age range already in our target market. 

This is just the start in creating our target and secondary target markets. We could run more pin pointed calculations on our current players in order to be more effective in our advertising department.
